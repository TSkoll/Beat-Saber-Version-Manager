# Beat Saber Version Manager

Beat Saber Version Manager (BSVM) is a program that allows the user to quickly create backups of their Beat Saber installations and allows them to quickly swap between versions.

The program currently has full support for the following Beat Saber versions:

- 1.6.2
- 1.6.1
- 1.6.0
- 1.5.0

Versions below 1.5.0 can be backed up and brought back to the game files, but may not work as intended when the game has been launched. This program works best when you downgrade using [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1805934840).
